# Task List App - Component for 'Pomify' Project

This is a task list I created following freecodecamps guide: React & TypeScript - Course for Beginners. This guide refreshed my mind on React, but also taught me about TypeScript and how the two work together. 

More detailed notes to come, along with pdfs of my handwritten notes.
